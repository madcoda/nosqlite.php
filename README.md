# NoSQLite â€“ simple key => value store based on SQLite3

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/madcoda/nosqlite.php.png)](https://travis-ci.org/madcoda/nosqlite.php)

## Introduction

NoSQLite is simple key-value store using SQLite as raw data store. Mainly for small project where MySQL is too heavy and files are too ugly.

Library is fully covered with unit tests.

## Requirements

- PHP >=5.3.2
    - PDO (by default as of PHP 5.1.0)
    - PDO_SQLITE (by default as of PHP 5.1.0)

## Installing via Composer

[Get composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) and add following lines to ```composer.json```:
```
{
    "require": {
        "madcoda/nosqlite": "dev-master"
    },
    "repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/madcoda/nosqlite.php"
    }
    ]
}
```

## Usage

Create stores' manager (file will be created if not exists)

        $nsql = new NoSQLite\NoSQLite('mydb.sqlite');
        $store = $nsql->getStore('movies');

Set value in store (key and value max length are [limited by SQLite TEXT datatype](http://sqlite.org/limits.html#max_length))

        $newId = uniqid();
        $store->set('doc:'.$newId, json_encode(array('title' => 'Good Will Hunting', 'director' => 'Gus Van Sant'));

Set Typed values
    
    // Integer
    $store->setInt('comment:123:count', 90);

    // Boolean
    $store->setBoolean('post:123:is_read', true);
    $store->getBoolean('post:123:is_read');

    // Float
    $store->setFloat('product:123:price', 49.99);

    // Date
    $store->setDate('product:123:modified', "2013-01-01 12:00:00");
    $store->setDate('product:123:modified', "2013-07-01");

Get value from store (will be created if not exists)

        $value = $store->get('doc:3452345');

Get all values

        $store->getAll();

Delete all values

        $store->deleteAll();

Iterate through store (Store implements Iterator interface)

        foreach($store as $key => $value)
            ...

Get number of values in store (Store implements Countable interface)

        count($store);

## Tests

Tests are written in PHPUnit which is required as a dev package in ```composer.json```. For running test use

    composer install
    make test
